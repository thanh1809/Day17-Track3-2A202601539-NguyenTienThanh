`<USER_SUMMARY> Minh Nguyen's personal project is ORCHID-27, for which they prefer Python. For the company project BLUEBIRD-42, the backend must use TypeScript with NestJS, not Python.  Minh prefers Python for personal demos (ORCHID-27) and dislikes Java. For coding explanations, Minh prefers short examples. Minh's efficient approach to resolving connection churn involves reusing the aiohttp ClientSession and setting concurrency to 20, as increasing the timeout was ineffective. Minh needs to complete a benchmark report by Friday at 16:00.  When explaining async/await and coroutines versus Tasks, use a timeline. The AI will prioritize timelines when explaining coroutines and Tasks. </USER_SUMM`
